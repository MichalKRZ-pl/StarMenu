# StarMenu

Star shaped menu for webpages built using sass

Small side project made to experiment with elements positioning, will work correctly as long as main container has square shape

At the moment sizes of wheels and diagonals can be customized using sass variables

planned features:

- java script to dynamically adjust size of container
- changing main wheel into home button
